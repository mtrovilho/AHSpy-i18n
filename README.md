Help us translate (or spellcheck) [AHSpy](http://www.ahspy.com) to other locales!

Simply grab any of the files included and change the right part of each line of text you see. Here's an example:

This line here:

    "Price per item - Last 48 hours": "Price per item - Last 48 hours",
    
Would become this in the french file (fr.js):

    "Price per item - Last 48 hours": "Prix par article - 48 heures",
    
Please try to be careful not to break anything, when possible. Also, be descriptive in your pull requests.

Thanks!
