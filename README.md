Help us translate (or spellcheck) [AHSpy](http://www.ahspy.com) to other locales!
===========

Simply grab any of the files included and change the right part of each line of text you see. Here's an example:

This line here:

    "Price per item - Last 48 hours": "Price per item - Last 48 hours",
    
Would become this in the french file (fr.js):

    "Price per item - Last 48 hours": "Prix par article - 48 heures",
    
Please try to be careful not to break anything, when possible. Also, be descriptive in your pull requests.

Thanks!

## Additional things you might need to know

* You need a github account to contribute. If you don't have one, make sure you read [Fork a Repo](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) and [Send pull requests](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/).
* International characters can be left as is. Our template engine will render them correctly.
* We use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to generate the HTML for things like links.
* If you find a typo in the english version, please create [a new issue](https://github.com/Fuitad/AHSpy-i18n/issues/new) instead of updating the en.js file.
* Double quotes need to be escaped with a slash so " needs to be written as \\".
